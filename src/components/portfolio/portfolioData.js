      "I orchestrated a purpose-driven content strategy specifically tailored for Homonoia, a sustainable French accessories brand. This included identifying the key values to communicate, raising awareness about environmental and social impact, and planning each content piece around brand-relevant themes and events (such as Earth Day or ethical fashion milestones). Every content piece—be it Instagram or Pinterest visuals, story highlights, or educational posts—was designed to beautifully reflect Homonoia's aesthetic and reinforce its ethical positioning. I managed the visual storytelling across different platforms to ensure brand cohesion and increased organic visibility through strategic cross-posting.",

I also managed the production of professional photography and collection visuals, overseeing art direction and styling so that every image authentically represented Homonoia's story and values.",
